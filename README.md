# Upselling Feature

Welcome to the Upselling Feature project! This powerful and ethical data analysis project leverages DBT (Data Build Tool) to generate an incremental table for analyzing sales data and evaluating upselling performance.

## Table Description

The `Upselling_Feature` table contains dummy data that has been specifically created for this project. It ensures the ethical code we uphold by not sharing any sensitive or real customer data. The data is designed to represent realistic scenarios, allowing you to explore and gain insights into sales and upselling trends without compromising privacy or confidentiality.

## Code Functionality

The provided SQL code performs the following tasks:

- Retrieves sales data from the `your_sales_table` table in the `your_database` database.
- Filters out cancelled and returned orders based on the order status.
- Applies row numbering to select the latest records based on order, order line, and order line status.
- Joins the sales data with sales representatives and order activities information.
- Calculates various metrics, such as the count and sum of products and pieces for different order line statuses.
- Determines the upselling status based on specific conditions.
- Groups the data by order-related attributes.
- Applies row numbering to select the latest records based on the order ID and updated date.

## Features

- **Incremental Updates**: The `Upselling_Feature` table is built using an incremental materialization method, enabling efficient updates as new sales data arrives. This ensures that your analysis is always up-to-date.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Each column in the `Upselling_Feature` table has defined tests to ensure data quality. The tests include checks for not null values and accepted value types, guaranteeing reliable and consistent data for analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Upselling Feature project, follow these steps:

1. Install DBT: Make sure you have DBT installed on your local machine or the desired environment. You can refer to the DBT documentation for installation instructions.
2. Configure Your Database: Set up the necessary database configurations in your DBT project to connect to the `your_database` database.
3. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine or your DBT project directory.
4. Update Configurations: Update the DBT configuration files (e.g., `profiles.yml`) with your specific database and table details.
5. Run DBT Commands: Use DBT commands (e.g., `dbt run`, `dbt test`) to build and test the `Upselling_Feature` table.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project and configured the necessary settings, you can utilize the generated `Upselling_Feature` table to analyze sales data and evaluate upselling performance. Here are some potential use cases:

- **Sales Analysis**: Explore order creation dates, confirmation dates, and country-wise sales distribution to understand sales patterns and trends.
- **Order Status Evaluation**: Analyze order statuses and rejection/suspension channels to identify areas for improvement and optimize the order management process.
- **Upselling Performance**: Evaluate upsellable products, upselling attempts, and upselling status to measure the effectiveness of upselling strategies and identify opportunities for revenue growth.
- **Product Quantity Insights**: Analyze base and upsell quantities (number of products and pieces) to gain insights into customer preferences and product demand.

Please note that all the data used in this project is dummy data. It has been generated solely for the purpose of showcasing the functionality of the Upselling Feature project. The use of dummy data ensures compliance with ethical standards and safeguards the privacy of real customers.

Feel free to explore the project, adapt the code to your specific business needs, and leverage additional SQL queries or visualization tools to gain deeper insights from the `Upselling_Feature` table!
